                        For too many election cycles, Virginia voters have only had a single Democrat on the ballot for
                        U.S. Senate. I believe that Virginians deserve to have a progressive choice. In 2026, I'll be
                        running in the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate as a progressive alternative to our incumbent,
                        Senator Mark Warner.

                                        Politicization of the courts along with an unwillingness of Republicans to
                                        defend the Constitution have turned our country into a theocratic dictatorship. When we regain
                                        the majority, we must place guardrails around our democracy to ensure that no
                                        party or person is able to derail our government.</p>

                                    <p>Healthcare costs are out of control and our profit-first system benefits nobody
                                        except the companies and their shareholders. We need to adopt a system where

                                        medical care because of the cost. When I am elected, I will work with my fellow
                                        progressives to reform our healthcare system to lower costs.</p>

                                        rural areas and after hours care in all areas. We need to incentivize medical

                                    <p>America has gone from a global leader to a global outcast.</p>
                                    <p>We were once the leader of the free world, but no longer. We are abandoning our
                                        traditional allies and embracing dictators. We are openly encouraging conflict
                                        and driving instability. We must renew our partnerships with our allies and
                                        begin encouraging global stability.</p>
                                    <p>We need to end the genocide in Gaza immediately by refusing to provide Israel
                                        with offensive weaponry. The continued military actions have gone well beyond
                                        self defense and are now clearly meant to punish all Palestinians, the majority
                                        of which were not eligible to vote in the last parliamentary or presidential
                                        elections. Just as we must recognize the right of the Israeli people to exist,
                                        we must recognize the right of the Palestinian people to exist and must insist
                                        that the two groups begin negotiating for a way to coexist peacefully.</p>
                                    <p>We must also renew our support for Ukraine in their fight against Russian
                                        aggression. Allowing Ukraine to fall to the Russians, or negotiating a
                                        settlement that does not include the return of all Ukrainian territory is
                                        unacceptable. If we allow Russia to conquer Ukraine they will not stop. It will
                                        be the first domino on the path to another world war. Despite what Russian
                                        apologists will tell you, we are not shipping billions of dollars directly to
                                        Ukraine. In fact, around 70% of all aid has actually gone to American companies
                                        or to U.S. forces.</p>
