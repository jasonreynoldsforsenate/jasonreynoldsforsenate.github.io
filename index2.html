                        <p>Healthcare costs are out of control and our profit-first system benefits nobody except the
                            companies and their shareholders. We need to adopt a system where unexpected illnesses don't
                            lead to bankruptcy or force people to skip necessary medical care because of the cost. When
                            I am elected, I will work with my fellow progressives to reform our healthcare system to
                            lower costs.</p>
                        <p>In addition to reducing costs, we also need to expand access to primary care in rural areas
                            and after hours care in all areas. We need to incentivize medical professionals to serve
                            where the need is the greatest. I believe we can do this by first committing to build
                            hospitals, clinics, and urgent care facilities where we currently have none.</p>
                            <p>When elected, I will propose a program to trade the commitment to serve in a rural hospital or after care facility for tuition payments or student loan repayment. This plan would also include additional funds to build/convert medical facilities where needed.</p>

                            that a lower tax rate on the wealthiest Americans and corporations would lead to opportunities for the rest
                            of us. This has led to the rich continuing to get richer while the poor stay poor. We cannot continue to pretend that this system is fair.</p>
                        <p>As your Senator, I will propose a new maximum tax rate for individuals of 55%. This would apply to anyone earning more than $500k per year ($1 million for families). I would also raise the corporate tax rate to 35% for any corporations with incomes over $5 million.</p>

                            allies and embracing dictators. We are openly encouraging conflict and driving instability.
                            We must renew our partnerships with our allies</p>
                        <p>We need to end the genocide in Gaza immediately by refusing to provide Israel with offensive
                            weaponry. The continued military actions have gone well beyond self defense and are now
                            clearly meant to punish all Palestinians, the majority of which were not eligible to vote in
                            the last parliamentary or presidential elections. Just as we must recognize the right of the
                            Israeli people to exist, we must recognize the right of the Palestinian people to exist and
                            must insist that the two groups begin negotiating for a way to coexist peacefully.</p>
                        <p>We must also renew our support for Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression.
                            Allowing Ukraine to fall to the Russians, or negotiating a settlement that does not include
                            the return of all Ukrainian territory is unacceptable. If we allow Russia to conquer Ukraine
                            they will not stop. It will be the first domino on the path to another world war. Despite
                            what Russian apologists will tell you, we are not shipping billions of dollars directly to
                            Ukraine. In fact, around 70% of all aid has actually gone to American companies or to U.S.
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>As your Senator, I will fight to end military aid to Israel until peace has been negotiated and expand military aid to Ukraine until Russia has been driven out of the country. I will also work to restore our valuable international friendships and ensure we appropriately punish anyone working to make the world less peaceful and secure.</p>

                        <p>Social Security is a program that we have been paying into every year that we've worked.
                            Despite this being <em>our</em> money, for years Congress has been treating Social Security
                            like a a child treats their piggy bank. Constantly borrowing and never paying it back.</p>
                        <p>It's time that Congress stops borrowing your hard earned money and starts refilling the pot.
                            Most importantly, we need to prohibit the government from stealing our social security funds
                            to pay for other projects. Along with this, we need to remove the Social Security tax limit.
                            Why should the wealthy not have to pay Social Security tax on anything earned over $176K.
                            Removing this limit is projected to generate billions of dollars of additional revenue over
                            the next decade and could shore up the program for generations.</p>
                        <p>When elected I will work to introduce legislation to remove the Social Security tax limit and
                            prevent Congress from appropriating our Social Security dollars for any other program.
