We need to adopt a system where unexpected illnesses don't lead to bankruptcy or force people to skip necessary medical care because of the cost. When I am elected, I will work with my fellow progressives to reform our healthcare system to lower costs.<br />
                                            In addition to reducing costs, we also need to expand access to primary care in rural areas and after hours care in all areas. We need to incentivize medical professionals to serve where the need is the greatest. I believe we can do this by first committing to build hospitals, clinics, and urgent care facilities where we currently have none. To attract the needed staff, we can offer tuition repayment for anyone willing to work at one of the new locations</p>

                                            We need to end the genocide in Gaza immediately by refusing to provide Israel with offensive weaponry. The continued military actions have gone well beyond self defense and are now clearly meant to punish all Palestinians, the majority of which were not eligible to vote in the last parliamentary or presidential elections. Just as we must recognize the right of the Israeli people to exist, we must recognize the right of the Palestinian people to exist and must insist that the two groups begin negotiating for a way to coexist peacefully.<br />
                                            We must also renew our support for Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression. Allowing Ukraine to fall to the Russians, or negotiating a settlement that does not include the return of all Ukrainian territory is unacceptable. If we allow Russia to conquer Ukraine they will not stop. It will be the first domino on the path to another world war. Despite what Russian apologists will tell you, we are not shipping billions of dollars directly to Ukraine. In fact, around 70% of all aid has actually gone to American companies or to U.S. forces.

                                            <p>It is a system that you have paid into every time you've gotten a paycheck.<br />
                                            For years, Congress has been treating Social Security like a a child treats their piggy bank. Constantly borrowing and never paying it back.<br />
                                            It's time that Congress stops borrowing your hard earned money and starts refilling the pot. Most importantly, we need to prohibit the government from stealing our social security funds to pay for other projects. We also need to remove the Social Security tax limit. Why should the wealthy not have to pay Social Security tax on anything earned over $176K. Removing this limit is projected to generate billions of dollars of additional revenue over the next decade.<br />
                                            When elected I will work to introduce legislation to remove the Social Security tax limit and prevent Congress from appropriating our Social Security dollars for any other program.

                                            <p>America has ignored its workers for too long. We need to enact a set of progressive policies that ensure working Americans are not left behind again. Minimum wage is too low. Rents are rising too rapidly. Credit card and student loan interest rates are too high. The list goes on and on.<br />
                                            We need legislation to address a minimum wage that has not kept up with rising costs. We need legislation that caps interest rates. We need legislation that encourages states to build more affordable housing. We need legislation that punishes corporations that are guilty of price gouging. These are just some of the issues I will fight for once elected.</p>
